Decentralized University System
The Decentralized University System is a blockchain-based application deployed on the Sepolia testnet. It leverages the Ethereum blockchain to create a transparent and secure platform for managing university operations. The backend is implemented using Solidity smart contracts, which handle student and professor management, course creation and enrollment, and a grading system. This ensures that all data and operations are immutable and decentralized.

The project also includes a user-friendly frontend, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Web3.js enabling seamless interaction with the blockchain. Users can connect to the platform through MetaMask and interact with the smart contracts. Students can enroll in courses and view their grades, professors can manage courses and assign grades, and the admin oversees the entire system, managing students, professors, and courses.

This application demonstrates the power of blockchain technology in creating a decentralized and secure backend system for a university management system. The deployed contract address on the Sepolia testnet is 0x0F2866115d6b3C7b623469A99A7b34D142dA505b.

To run the project, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and deploy the smart contract to the Sepolia testnet (or use the provided contract address). The frontend can be launched by opening the index.html file in a browser.

This project showcases the potential of blockchain in real-world applications by integrating transparency, security, and decentralization into university operations.
